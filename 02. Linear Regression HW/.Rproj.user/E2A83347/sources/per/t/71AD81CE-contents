```{r}

```


Build a logistic regression model on the train data set and comment on the coeficients' significance.

```{r}

```

Interprete the relationship between the independent variables on the logits and odds of being classified as having Diabetes 

```{r}

```

Make predictions on the test data set
Using the threshhold of 0.5 and then 0.6 to convert probabilities into classes.Create a confusion matrixes for both cases.
Comment on the indicators (Accuracy, Sensitiviy, Specificity, NPV and PPV)

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

Create a ROC curves for each case and comment on it.
Calculate AUC value  and make relevant comparisons.

```{r}
